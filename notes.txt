sat-data.services.ts/initSatList
TODO: don't init all sats at once at beginning; this will exceed number
of calls per hour. Maybe try only loading when launch group is selected or
find a more elegant ui/ux design for displaying sats. 

side-menu.component.ts/side-menu.html
TODO: close other groups when new one opens
TODO: implement AngularMaterial: Expansion Panel, and make ids

TODO:
in initSatsList() store the satList in localStorage so I have an fresh instance once a day and 
the list is only initialized once a day
